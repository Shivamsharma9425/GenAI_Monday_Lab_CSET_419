# Dog Breed Classification using CNN

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for dog breed classification using a synthetic dataset.

## Key Components
- Synthetic dataset generation using Stable Diffusion
- 20 dog breeds, 20 images per breed (400 images total)
- CNN model: ResNet-18 (PyTorch)
- Transfer learning applied

## Repository Structure
- Dataset_Generation/: code to generate synthetic dataset
- Sample_Generated_Images/: small subset of generated images
- Model/: trained CNN model
- Training/: model training scripts

## Full Dataset
Due to size limitations, the full dataset is hosted externally:
